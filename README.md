# AfriFuta — African Football Talent Hub

AfriFuta connects talented African footballers with scouts, agents, and clubs around the world. The platform enables players to showcase their skills, access tryout opportunities, and build professional profiles to attract attention from decision-makers in the football industry.

---

## Problem Statement

Despite the immense football talent in Africa, many players struggle to access professional opportunities due to:

- Lack of centralized platforms for showcasing talent
- Limited access to scouts and tryout information
- Poor communication between players, agents, and clubs
- Inconsistent data about player performance and activities

---

## Proposed Solution

AfriFuta aims to solve these issues by offering:

- A central platform for players to create and manage football profiles
- Visibility to scouts and agents searching for talent
- Access to trials, camps, and club opportunities
- Structured data to monitor player development and timelines

---

## System Overview

AfriFuta is built using:

- React (with Vite) for frontend development
- TypeScript for type safety
- Tailwind CSS for responsive UI design
- shadcn/ui component library for consistent styling
- Supabase-ready backend integration (can be plugged in)
